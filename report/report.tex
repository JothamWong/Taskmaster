\section{Motivation}

Serverless computing is a rapidly growing cloud application model that sees popularity among startups and small-mid scale companies due to its advantage in blackboxing architectural constraints. However, it is plagued by a problem known as cold starts where time required to start up containers with their dependencies dominates. Chris Munns proposed that "pinging" a serverless function was really the only way to mitigate the issue of cold starts \cite{jeremydaly}.
