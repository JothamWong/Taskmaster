## Motivation

Serverless computing is a rapidly growing cloud application model that sees popularity among startups and small-mid scale companies due to its advantage in blackboxing architectural constraints. However, it is plagued by a problem known as cold starts where time required to start up containers with their dependencies dominates. In this report, we investigate the use of ML models to predict incoming function requests and keep alive function containers to minimize user waiting time.
